                <p class="section-text">
                    In many ways, Berkeley makes it easy to report on. It is a small city that leaves an outsize
                    mark in the national, even international, imagination. Its citizens, drawn here for its bay-side
                    location, its outlook, and its world-class university, have made it a trailblazing place: It was
                    the first city to adopt single-family zoning and the legacy of that decision lives on, and among
                    the first places to adopt a voluntary busing plan to fully integrate its public schools;
                    the first to successfully levy a tax on sugary drinks and to create a dog park and a tool
                    lending library. The list goes on.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    But often it's the smaller stories that capture the attention of our team of journalists — and
                    are most appreciated by our readers: the community coming out to celebrate the retirement of a
                    longstanding postal carrier; the enthusiasm for small independent businesses; the kindness shown
                    by neighbors during the pandemic lockdown; a consistent appreciation of the wildlife that
                    surrounds us.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    For much of the city's life, the chronicles of Berkeley could be read in a number of local
                    newspapers. But, by 2009, nobody was consistently telling the story of Berkeley any more. That’s
                    why three journalist friends who had met at their children's school launched a news site to fill
                    the void.

                <p class="section-text">
                    People I meet here tell me all the time that they can't imagine life without Berkeleyside, that
                    it is Berkeleyside's journalism that helps them engage with and enjoy their city.

                <p class="section-text">And Berkeleyside now stands as a national model for what successful,
                    sustainable local news can look like. We used what we learned from the first 10 years of
                    Berkeleyside to form the nonprofit Cityside Journalism Initiative, which has birthed two more
                    local news outlets: The Oaklandside and Richmondside. By sharing central resources and
                    leadership, all of our newsrooms, including Berkeleyside, are significantly strengthened thanks
                    to Cityside. </p>

                    As we mark Berkeleyside's 15th birthday, the Berkeleyside team and its three co-founders — myself,
                    Frances Dinkelspiel
                    and Lance Knobel — would like to thank the Berkeley community for its support and encouragement
                    on this sometimes bumpy journey. The business of news is hard to crack, but if it was going to
                    work anywhere, it was going to be Berkeley.

                        <p>A five-alarm fire at the Sequoia Apartments at 2441 Haste St. on Nov. 18, 2011 was described
                            as
                            “a hideous development to an already totally beat-up Telegraph” by Marc Weinstein, owner of
                            neighboring Amoeba Music. The disaster, which left dozens homeless but caused no injuries,
                            was a tipping point for Southside, and Berkeley more broadly, in that it underscored the
                            potential perils of older housing stock and ushered in a new era of much needed new housing
                            construction.

                        <p>Berkeleyans from multiple generations went into mourning after the Tuolumne Family Camp

                            by the city, the popular camp along the Tuolumne River near Yosemite National Park had been
                            around since 1922. </p>

                        <p>The story had a happy ending, however, as nine years later, in May 2022,
                            it reopened. Berkeleyside published a photo gallery of the beautiful new camp that rose from
                            the ashes and welcomed back guests that spring.</p>

                        <p>Berkeley held its most expensive election in 2014 with around $3.6 million spent on two
                            ballot items alone. One of them was the soda tax, a 1-cent-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks.
                            The soda industry spent nearly $2.5 million to defeat it. </p>

                        <p>Former New York City Mayor Michael
                            Bloomberg donated $657,000 to support it. The measure passed. And it appears to have worked:
                            A 2019 UC Berkeley study showed residents in diverse and low-income Berkeley neighborhoods
                            reported drinking 52% fewer servings of sugary drinks than they did before the soda tax went

                        <p>Six young lives were lost when a balcony collapsed in downtown Berkeley on the night of June
                            16, 2015. The tragedy happened when an Irish student who had come to Berkeley to work for
                            the summer, part of a tradition of Irish summer students, was celebrating her 21st birthday
                            with friends in her apartment at what was then called Library Gardens </p>

                        <p>Thirteen people were on the balcony of the apartment when it sheared off the building. The
                            tragedy was a wake-up call that led to the revelation that more than 400 buildings in
                            Berkeley were in need of repairs, and, eventually, to tougher legislation on balcony
                            construction state-wide.

                        <p>In the fall of 2018, the sprawling Pacific Steel Casting plant with its distinctive blue
                            pipes shut down after 84 years of operating in West Berkeley. The closure of one of the
                            city’s last big “smokestack” factories meant the end of well-paid union jobs, but it also
                            meant neighbors would no longer be concerned that the ‘burnt pot handle’ smell in the air
                            could harm their health. And it symbolized the transition of West Berkeley as a heavy
                            manufacturing hub to a life sciences research and development hub.</p>

                        <p>In February 2017, the arrival of the far-right agitator Milo Yiannopoulos on the Cal campus
                            prompted black-clad masked protesters to smash windows and rampage through Berkeley,
                            ultimately causing UC Berkeley to cancel his slated speech. It turned out to be the first
                            of 11 often violent skirmishes, dubbed the Battles of Berkeley, that roiled Berkeley and the
                            university that year.</p>

                            start a revolution. When discussing the location of his new cafe, co-owner Nick Cho spoke
                            critically of the moniker long used for North Berkeley’s famed culinary district. Alice
                            Waters followed suit, telling us the neighborhood nickname “has nothing but bad connotations
                            really.” A little more than a month after the story was published, the area’s business
                            district renamed the area North Shattuck. </p>

                        <p>It should probably have come as no surprise that our then education reporter Ally Markovich
                            was awarded a James Madison Freedom of Information Award for her 2021 investigation that
                            revealed how Berkeley High administrators had failed to protect generations of students who
                            accused a chemistry teacher of sexual misconduct. Markovich spent four months interviewing
                            students, researching issues around sexual harm and filing increasingly detailed public
                            records requests seeking the teacher’s disciplinary records. It was only after Berkeleyside
                            threatened a lawsuit that the school district turned over relevant records. In accepting the
                            award, Markovich said it was a testament to Berkeleyside’s willingness to support long-term,
                            in-depth reporting.

                            15 years ago, when city leaders, under pressure from so-called NIMBY homeowners, put the
                            kibosh on all but a few development proposals. </p>
                        <p>But with the housing crisis came a power
                            shift as state legislation was enacted that limits local governments’ authority over many
                            development decisions. Married to that came mandates that speed up approvals for affordable
                            housing and backyard cottages, end single-family zoning and allow apartment buildings at
                            BART stations. As a result, Berkeley could look very different a decade from now.</p>

                        </h2>

                        <p>The story of People’s Park began long before the arrival of Berkeleyside. Nevertheless, the
                            city’s most fiercely contested land has made news headlines many times over the past 15
                            years.</p>

                        <p>In 2024, after decades of clashes between activists and authorities — in the courts, on the
                            grass and in the trees — the university got the green-light to implement its $400 million
                            plan to build housing for students, supportive housing for formerly homeless residents, a
                            park and a historical monument on the 3-acre Southside plot.</p>
                        <p>In 2023, Berkeleyside’s visual journalist Ximena Natera produced an audio-visual project
                            about the “people of the park” — those who became entwined in the park’s long history and
                            dedicated themselves to stewarding the land, and those who served as a conduit between the
                            university and park advocates.</p>

                        <p>Despite their impressive size, the boulder outcroppings in North Berkeley can be taken for
                            granted by local residents. In late 2023, Berkeleyside published a richly visual two-part
                            series on Indian and Mortar Rocks. </p>

                        <p>In words and photos, the articles examined the famous boulders from two perspectives: as
                            places of contemplation, ceremony, gossip and industry for the Ohlone, but also as symbol of
                            a destroyed cultural landscape; and as a place which has taken rock climbing to new heights,
                            attracting, over the years, a fiercely loyal community of climbers who have puzzled over the
                            rock faces and devised new challenges to traverse the rhyolite.
